$ vim filename.c

It will create a new file and show like ""filename.c" [New File]" at bottom of screen.
Now to edit and add something into the file we have to change to "Insert" mode, to do this
hit "Insert" button from the keyboard, and file will be ready to edit with message like
-- INSERT -- at the bottom of screen.

Now, using can use below keys to actually write some code.
"Enter" - If you want to add new line
Right, Left Arrow Key - To move cursor from right to left
Up, Down Arrow Key - To move cursor from one line to another
Space - To add space

Lets say, we will write the code as,

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
	printf("Hello World");
	return 0;
}

Once you have written above code, and now you are sure that you want to
save this file, type below key sequence.

ESCAPE
:wq!

The meaning of above key sequence is, ESCAPE removes "Insert" Mode
:w is for writing the file
q is for quitting the file
! is for force quit.
so ":wq!" becomes save and quit.
":w" becomes only save
"q!" becomes quit without saving.

Now, after saving & closing file, you will see the newly created "filename.c"
as

$ ls -alh
-rw-rw-r--  1 myuser myuser   76 Aug 26 21:47 filename.c
